### UdacityAndroidTrack

These are all the excercises as well as notes on Udacity's Free Course [Developing Android Apps with Kotlin](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps-with-kotlin--ud9012).
Will try and make this readme more useful in the near future. Hopefully on a weekly basis as i progress through the Course.
